# ObjectOrientedProgramming
Language: Java

OOP:
I did this project by following along YouTube videos.
Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is instance of a class. Its able to describe an object by its attributes and methods.

How?
Car.java file: attributes and methods of car is listed.
Attributes are characteristic of the objects, such as price, color, model, and year.
Its listed as a variable with value and type. 
While in the method, its the action performed of a car, like drive and brake. Its done in the void. 

Main.java: Name the classes and call the object.
For attributes, we use the System.out.println(nameOftheObj.method). For methods, we call the nameOfTheObj.method().

***Important:
A class can be reuse to create multiple objects.
An example of another class is ourCar().
